Description: This package assists the process of obtaining and manipulating 
    microdata published by Worldbank, FAO, UNHCR and IHSN. The workflow starts 
    with getting available surveys using `surveys()` function. After finding the 
    survey catalog number and title, create `new_workbook()` to store scrapped 
    information about the data. Then, obtain `metadata()` of the survey. 
    Next, extract `dictionary()` of each survey files and write them to the workbook.
    `dictionary()` function extracts variable names and their descriptions 
    from the web. Use `to_workbook()` to write the new table to an existing 
    excel workbook. Finally, the `import_csv()` function reads local data and 
    applies data attributes from the excel workbook. For more, see help of each function.

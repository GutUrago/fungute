Description: This package assists the process of obtaining and manipulating 
    microdata published by Worldbank, FAO, UNHCR and IHSN. The work flow starts 
    with creating `new_workbook()`, obtaining `metadata()` then loading `dictionary()` 
    to write them to the workbook.
    `dictionary()` function extracts variable names and their descriptions 
    from the web. Then, use `to_workbook()` to write the new table to an existing 
    excel work book. Finally, the `import_csv()` function reads local data and 
    applies data attributes from the excel workbook.
